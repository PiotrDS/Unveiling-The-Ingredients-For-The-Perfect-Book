# Unveiling-The-Ingredients-For-The-Perfect-Book :book: :book:

The project was carried out by a three-person team, with the goal of creating an aesthetically pleasing poster featuring data visualizations from a selected dataset. The visualizations were created in the R environment using libraries such as dplyr and ggplot2.

For the analysis, we used a dataset on books collected by the [Goodreads platform](https://www.goodreads.com) and made available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/4265096).

As part of the project, we focused on visualizing three key aspects of the highest-rated books:

Most frequently rated genres – which literary genres are most commonly rated highly by users.
Geography of book settings – in which countries the stories of these books most often take place.
Description analysis – which words appear most frequently in the descriptions of these books.

The results of the project are as follows:
